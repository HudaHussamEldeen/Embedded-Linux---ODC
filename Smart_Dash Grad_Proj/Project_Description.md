# Embedded Linux ODC Project

This project is a user interface system designed for the Raspberry Pi, allowing users to interact with various modules such as Smart Home, Smart TV, and Car Infotainment. The system is built using Python and PyQt5 for the graphical interface, and it integrates with external APIs and hardware for functionality.
We have successfully integrated the application with the Raspberry Pi. Once the Raspberry Pi is powered on, the application automatically launches. Additionally, a customized logo appears during the booting process, providing a personalized touch to the system.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Raspberry Pi with Raspbian OS.
- Python 3.x installed.
- Required Python libraries: `PyQt5`, `pygame`, `vlc`, `yt-dlp`, `paho-mqtt`, `opencv-python`, `speechrecognition`.

### Requirements
- 1024x600 display resolution

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmalAliEg/Embedded_Linux_ODC.git
   cd Embedded_Linux_ODC

2. Install the required Python libraries:
    ```python 
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set up the Raspberry Pi:
    - Ensure the camera module is connected and enabled.
    - Configure the MQTT broker settings in the RoomsScreen.py file if needed.
4. Run the application:
    ```python 
    python MainScreen.py

## Future Work
- Integration with Yocto/Buildroot: 
        Replace Raspbian with a custom Linux distribution built using Yocto or Buildroot for better optimization and customization.

- Enhanced Voice Control: 
        Add more voice commands and improve speech recognition accuracy.

- IoT Integration: 
        Expand the Smart Home module to support more IoT devices and protocols.

-Advanced Lane Detection: 
        Improve the lane detection algorithm for better accuracy and reliability.
## Project Structure
- main.py: Entry point of the application.
- HomeScreen.py: Implements the Smart Home module.
- TvScreen.py: Implements the Smart TV module.
- CarScreen.py: Implements the Car Infotainment module.
- RoomsScreen.py: Handles room-specific controls using MQTT.
- utils.py: Utility functions for path managment.
